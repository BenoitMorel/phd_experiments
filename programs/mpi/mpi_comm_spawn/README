spawner is a MPI program that spawns instances of mpi_fake_program with a given number of ranks each, and wait for their completion to start a new instance.
Everything is hardcoded and this was just used for experiments before implementing raxml.

Compilation:
cd build
cmake ..
make

Usage:
(from build)
mpirun -np 1 spawner
